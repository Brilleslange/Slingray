**Twilight Imperium 4th Edition Color Assigner**

Slingray is a tool designed to help players of Twilight Imperium 4th Edition assign colors during setup.
It automatically assigns colors based on which colors would be most fitting for the players' chosen factions, 
and includes settings to help colorblind players.

**Slingray is available at www.slingray.net**

The tool currently includes colors and factions available in the base game
and the Prophecy of Kings and Thunder's Edge expansions.

Note that for the new color and factions from Thunder's Edge, default color weighting has not yet been added,
but it is possible to add your own.
